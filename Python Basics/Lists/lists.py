#What is a list?
# A list is a data struture that is mutable, ordered sequence of items.
# Each element inside a list is called an item.

# List Vs Array
# Array is homogeneoud, List is heterogeneous
# Arrays store elements continuously but not lists.
# Arrays are much faster because of continuous storage of elements.
# Lists are more programmer friendly but that makes them slower to arrays in executiom.
